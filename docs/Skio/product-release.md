## Introduction

This plan identifies all external Help Center documentation and internal knowledge base content needed to support this feature launch.

The document is designed for technical writers, documentation managers, support leads and product teams who need to understand what content must be created, updated or maintained to successfully launch and support POS subscription functionality. All documentation will follow Skio's established style guides and content standards.

**Release details:**
- **Feature:** Shopify POS integration enabling in-person subscription sales
- **Target Launch:** [Date TBD]
- **Documentation Owner:** Technical Writing Team

**Note:** This document distinguishes between existing Help Center articles that need updates (with URLs researched and linked) and new articles that need to be created.

## User persona

This section provides a representative merchant use case to illustrate how the Shopify POS integration will be used in practice.

**Aly Anne Photography** is a small photography business based in Ottawa, Ontario, operating both online and through a local studio with Shopify POS. The business offers photography services for weddings, events and portraits, with a focus on building recurring revenue through subscription offerings. 

With the new Shopify POS integration, Aly can now sell subscription packages directly to clients during in-person consultations at her studio. For example, she can offer mini session subscriptions where clients commit to monthly portrait sessions, or monthly print subscriptions where customers receive curated prints each month. 

This POS integration enables her to activate subscriptions immediately during face-to-face interactions, creating a seamless experience for clients who prefer to sign up in person rather than online. The integration helps bridge her online and in-store presence, allowing her to grow her subscription revenue through both channels while maintaining consistent customer experiences.
