# Setting up and managing shipping profiles

A **shipping profile** is a set of shipping rules for specific products and locations. With the latest updates, Skio now allows you to create multiple shipping profiles tailored to specific selling plan groups. Previously, merchants could only create one shipping profile, which would assign all subscription products to it by default. This new feature introduces greater flexibility and automation, making it easier to manage shipping across different subscription offerings.

## Considerations for setting up shipping profiles

Before you set up your shipping profiles, review the following considerations:

- Each shipping profile can be assigned to specific selling plan groups or multiple selling plan groups can be assigned to a single shipping profile.
- New products added to a selling plan group automatically update the associated shipping profile, reducing manual effort.
- When a new selling plan group is created, you must select the shipping profile you want to assign to it.
- You can duplicate an existing Shopify shipping profile to copy its zones and rates to your Skio shipping profile.
- All shipping profile updates must be made directly in Shopify. To access Skio-specific shipping profiles, go to **Settings > Shipping and Delivery > View Profile** in your Shopify admin.

## Set up your shipping profile

You can create separate shipping profiles for each selling plan group or assign multiple selling plan groups to a single shipping profile. For example, you could set up a general shipping profile for all subscription products or a free shipping profile specifically for Build a Box subscriptions.

1. From your Skio dashboard, go to **Settings**.

2. Under the **Billing & Orders** section, click **Shipping**.

3. On the Shipping page, click **+ Create new profile** in the top-right corner.

4. Enter a name for your shipping profile in the **Shipping profile name** field. For example, "Subscription Free Shipping" or "Build a Box Shipping".

5. Under the **Selling plans included** section, search for the selling plans you want to assign to this profile.

6. Select the checkbox next to the relevant plans. A warning appears if the selected plan is already part of another shipping profile. Confirm to move it to the new profile.

7. Click **Create profile** to save your changes.

### Duplicate Shopify shipping profiles

You can duplicate an existing Shopify shipping profile to copy its zones and rates to your Skio shipping profile.

1. Scroll down to the **Select a source shipping profile from Shopify** section.

2. Choose an existing Shopify shipping profile to duplicate its zones and rates.

3. If you want to enable free shipping rates for this profile, then select the free shipping option.

## Create a custom shipping profile

You can create custom shipping profiles for specific subscription types or selling plan groups.

1. From your Skio dashboard, go to **Settings**.

2. Under the **Billing & Orders** section, click **Shipping**.

3. Click **+ Create new profile**.

4. Enter a name for your custom shipping profile.

5. Under the **Selling plans included** section, search for and select the selling plans you want to assign to this profile.

6. Configure the shipping settings for this profile.

## Configure shipping settings

You can adjust shipping settings to control how shipping is calculated and updated for your subscription orders.

In the **Shipping settings** section, adjust the following settings based on your preferences:

- **Update shipping if subscription changes**: Automatically recalculate shipping if a subscription is updated in Shopify.
- **Recurring free shipping override**: Guarantee free shipping for all subscription orders after checkout.
- **Exclude lines from shipping price calculation**: Prevent certain subscription items from impacting shipping prices.
- **Exclude out-of-stock items in shipping price calculation**: Ensure out-of-stock items do not affect shipping price calculations.

1. Click **Save changes** to finalize your shipping profile settings.

2. If necessary, click **Resync shipping** at the top-right to manually apply updates.

## Edit a shipping profile

You can edit any shipping profile to update its settings or assigned selling plans.

1. From your Skio dashboard, go to **Settings**.

2. Under the **Billing & Orders** section, click **Shipping**.

3. In the **Shipping** section, click a shipping profile that you want to edit.

4. Make any adjustments to your shipping profile.

5. Click **Save**.

## Delete a custom shipping profile

You can delete a custom shipping profile, but you cannot delete the general shipping profile.

1. From your Skio dashboard, go to **Settings**.

2. Under the **Billing & Orders** section, click **Shipping**.

3. In the **Shipping** section, click a custom shipping profile that you want to delete.

4. Click **Delete profile**, and then click **Delete profile** to confirm.

## Next steps

After you set up your shipping profiles, you can manage them from your Shopify admin. If you want to update shipping settings or create additional profiles, then go to **Settings > Shipping** in your Skio dashboard.
