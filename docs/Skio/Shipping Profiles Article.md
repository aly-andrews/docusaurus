## What is a shipping profile?

A shipping profile defines shipping rules for specific products and locations. In Skio, shipping profiles work alongside Shopify shipping profiles to manage shipping rates for your subscription products. You create shipping profiles in Skio and assign them to selling plan groups, while shipping zones and rates are managed in Shopify.

**Shopify shipping profiles** control shipping zones and rates for your products. **Skio shipping profiles** assign those Shopify shipping profiles to specific selling plan groups, allowing you to apply different shipping policies to different subscription types.

## Key benefits

**Flexibility:** Assign different shipping policies to various selling plan groups. For example, offer free shipping for specific subscription types while using default Shopify rates for others.

**Automation:** Products added to a selling plan group automatically update the associated shipping profile, reducing manual effort.

**Tailored control:** Each selling plan group requires a designated shipping profile upon creation, ensuring precision in shipping management.

## Prerequisites

Before you set up shipping profiles, ensure you have:

- Created selling plan groups in Skio. If your search bar comes up blank when selecting selling plans, you need to create selling plan groups first.
- Set up shipping zones and rates in Shopify. Learn more about [managing shipping in Shopify](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping).

## Set up your shipping profile

You can create separate shipping profiles for each selling plan group or assign multiple selling plan groups to a single shipping profile. For example, you could set up a general shipping profile for all subscription products or a free shipping profile specifically for Build a Box subscriptions.

From your Skio dashboard, go to **Settings**.

Under the **Billing & Orders** section, click **Shipping**.

Click the **+ Create new profile** button.

Enter a name for your shipping profile in the **Shipping profile name** field. For example, "Subscription Free Shipping" or "Build a Box Shipping".

Under the **Selling plans included** section, search for the selling plans you want to assign to this profile.

Select the checkbox next to the relevant plans. A warning appears if the selected plan is already part of another shipping profile. Confirm to move it to the new profile.

Click the **Create profile** button to save your changes.

### Duplicate Shopify shipping profiles

You can duplicate an existing Shopify shipping profile to copy its zones and rates to your Skio shipping profile. This is useful if you want to recreate a shipping profile for a different product or selling plan group with similar settings.

Find the **Select a source shipping profile from Shopify** section.

Choose an existing Shopify shipping profile to duplicate its zones and rates.

If you want to enable free shipping rates for this profile, select the free shipping option.

**Note:** To edit shipping zones and rates after duplicating, you must do so in Shopify. Learn more about [editing shipping profiles in Shopify](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/setting-up-shipping-profiles).

## Edit a shipping profile

You can edit any shipping profile to update its settings or assigned selling plans.

From your Skio dashboard, go to **Settings**.

Under the **Billing & Orders** section, click **Shipping**.

Click a shipping profile that you want to edit.

Make any adjustments to your shipping profile.

Click the **Save** button.

**Note:** To edit shipping zones and rates, you must do so in Shopify. Go to **Settings > Shipping and Delivery** in your Shopify admin, then click **View Profile** to access your Skio shipping profiles.

## Delete a custom shipping profile

You can delete a custom shipping profile, but you cannot delete the general shipping profile.

From your Skio dashboard, go to **Settings**.

Under the **Billing & Orders** section, click **Shipping**.

Click a custom shipping profile that you want to delete.

Click the **Delete profile** button, then click **Delete profile** again to confirm.

## Next steps

After you set up your shipping profiles, you can manage shipping zones and rates from your Shopify admin. To update shipping settings or create additional profiles, go to **Settings > Shipping** in your Skio dashboard.
