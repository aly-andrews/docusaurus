## Purpose

### School Assignment: Docusaurus Microsite Development

This microsite was created as part of **Assignment 3: Working with Docusaurus**, which required:

- Setting up and customizing a Docusaurus framework
- Creating personalized content and design elements
- Implementing custom styling and navigation
- Deploying the site to GitHub Pages

The project demonstrates proficiency in:
- Docusaurus framework configuration
- React component customization
- CSS styling and theming
- GitHub Pages deployment

### Mermaid Diagram Integration

Mermaid diagrams are integrated into this site to visualize workflows and processes. The installation and configuration process involved:

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install @docusaurus/theme-mermaid
```

**Configuration:**
The Mermaid theme was added to `docusaurus.config.js`:
```javascript
themes: ['@docusaurus/theme-mermaid'],
```

**Usage:**
Mermaid diagrams can be embedded in markdown files using code blocks with the `mermaid` language identifier:
````markdown
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[End]
```
````

This integration enables the creation of flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and other visual documentation directly within markdown content.

- **Part A: Product Release Documentation Plan** for Shopify POS Integration for Subscriptions

- Content prioritization and cross-linking strategies
- Audience-specific documentation approaches

The writing assignment demonstrates:
- Technical writing skills

## Background
